# Changelog

What changed in each release of Chartmate. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org); the desktop
app, the Docker image and the release tag share one version number.

## Unreleased

### Self-hosting

- `compose.yaml` runs the published image by default: download it and `docker compose up -d`, no `.env` needed
  (create one only to set a password, change the port or use Postgres).
- A simpler install guide: a one-line quick try, a two-command Compose install, and how to pin the image by
  version and digest and verify its build provenance.
- Each GitHub Release now carries its `compose.yaml` and `.env.example` (as `env.example`).
- Without a password, the server answers only to `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` and `[::1]` (any port) and refuses
  any other `Host` with a 403, so a web page cannot reach it through DNS rebinding. Add the names you use to the
  new `CHARTMATE_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, or set a password. Behind a trusted reverse proxy the `Host` header and every
  `X-Forwarded-Host` must be allowed; the proxy must pass the real host, and an exposed instance still needs a
  password.
- State-changing API requests (with or without a password) are refused when their `Origin` is not the page's
  own origin.

### Fixes

- Indicator settings store only the colors you change: the other lines (and the untouched up or down bar
  color) keep following the theme instead of freezing to the palette of the theme they were edited in.
- Failed drawing and watchlist saves are retried with backoff instead of being dropped, and a failed watchlist
  load is retried too. Until the watchlist has loaded it shows placeholder rows and cannot be edited, so an
  early edit is no longer lost.
- Deleting a basket removes it from the watchlist, clears its drawings and moves the chart to another symbol.
  A stale reference to a deleted basket shows as "Deleted basket" instead of retrying forever, and symbol
  lookups that fail for good (such as an unknown symbol) are no longer retried every 30 seconds.
- Parallel channel fills are a tint of the channel's own hue on the chart background (like position zones)
  instead of a plain translucent color, and the extended-hours shade uses a color tuned for each theme.
- Removing an indicator no longer re-creates the indicators after it, so their panes keep their heights and
  the chart does not flicker.
- A stored drawing without points is skipped when drawings load (it used to leave the chart in drawing mode),
  and the server drops such a drawing on save instead of rejecting the whole list.
- The price field of horizontal drawings rejects exponent notation (such as `1e-9`) and prices that round to
  zero at 8 decimals.
- Basket changes that round to zero read "0.00%" in the neutral color, as in the watchlist (no more "-0.00%"
  in the down color or "+0.00%" in the up color), and the basket preview formats numbers like the rest of the app.
- VWAP on a basket holding crypto resets at midnight UTC, like its bars, instead of midnight New York time.
- Stored indicator settings are checked when the layout loads: a period or other param outside its allowed
  range falls back to its default, and an invalid line color follows the theme again.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-14

The first stable release: a charting app for US stocks and ETFs, crypto and your own baskets, as a desktop app
for macOS and Windows and as a self-hosted server with a Docker image.

### Charts

- Candlestick, OHLC bar, line and area charts from 1 minute to 1 month, in a dark and a light theme.
- US stocks and ETFs with pre- and post-market data (a regular / extended hours toggle, extended hours shaded),
  and crypto priced in USD. Free market data from Yahoo Finance and Binance or Coinbase, cached locally.
- A last price capsule on the price axis that counts down to the bar close.
- Chart appearance per theme: candle colors and body style, last price line, line and area color, and the
  default style of new drawings.

### Indicators

- Moving averages, Bollinger Bands, VWAP, Parabolic SAR, volume, MACD, RSI, stochastic, CCI, ATR, PPO,
  Wyckoff accumulation and distribution, and more; up to 30 on a chart, the same set on every symbol.
- Line colors from a palette tuned for each theme, editable widths, styles and histogram colors.
- Dashed reference levels on oscillators (RSI 70 / 30, MACD at 0, …), editable or hidden per indicator.

### Drawing tools

- Trend line, ray, extended line, horizontal and vertical lines, price line, parallel channel, Fibonacci
  retracement, text, and long and short positions with target, stop, risk / reward and the trade's outcome.
- Saved per symbol and anchored to time and price, so they stay put across timeframes and zoom levels.
- Color swatches that follow the theme, with the last picked color used for new drawings; widths, line styles
  and exact prices.
- Copy and paste drawings, lock a single drawing or all of them, snap to prices with ⌘ or Ctrl, keep lines
  horizontal with Shift, and measure price, bars and time with a Shift-drag.

### Watchlist and baskets

- A watchlist with live quotes, pre- and post-market prices, 30-day sparklines and sections you can rename,
  collapse and reorder.
- A detail panel for the open symbol: market status, day range, volume and 52-week range.
- A resizable sidebar.
- Baskets: weighted sets of stocks and crypto charted like any symbol, with rebalancing versions and history
  before the basket's start.

### Desktop app

- Native installers for macOS (Apple silicon and Intel) and Windows (x64 and Arm), with a frameless window whose
  title bar is the app's own top bar.
- Your data stays on your computer: no account, no server and no network listener. The app runs sandboxed and
  connects only to the market data providers.
- The release notes say how each platform's build is signed. A notarized macOS release has its disk image
  notarized too, so macOS accepts the download as well as the app.

### Self-hosting

- A Docker image for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` on GitHub Container Registry, with a Compose file, SQLite or
  Postgres, an optional password login, and a hardened container (read-only, non-root, no capabilities).

### Licensing

- Chartmate is free software under the GNU AGPL-3.0.
